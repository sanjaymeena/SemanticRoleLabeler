## SRL Visualisation

* Users can choose what output they would like to see. For e.g. dependency parsing, SRL, Syntactic Parse tree etc. 
* Multiple outputs from SRL for understanding and debugging purpose: 
	* SRL Triple Format
	* HIT Format for better understading of span of arguments
	* CONLL2009 Format which is the main format processed by the system for training, output purposes.
* Documents on SRL available directly on the web page.	

## Evaluation metrics for SRL

* We will use standard CONLL2009 conference perl evaluation script for evaluation metrics for different components like : SRL output, Predicate Identification etc. 
* Results will be available in next release.


Next Version Info: 

# Next Version Info: 

1. Next SRL release will be for 10000 trained sentences  by monday, 12/9/16. 
2. Integrated code to provide evaluation results. 

* We have the ability to train following "Additional" components from our training data for conversation : 
	1. POS Tagger (confirmed)
	2. Dependency Parser (confirmed)
	3. Sentence Segmentation (Need some more analysis)

	We will provide the details on process for achieving the above tasks.

3. Data Analysis on the SRL data from different sources.


# SRL 1.3.2
It is released on taipei server (192.168.3.2) and dev server in shanghai (192.168.1.126)

1. New model SRL model trained on data : 
	1. Total sentences : 10817
	2. SRL sentences : 10207
	3. Memory sentences : 610 (New SRL Tag "TGT" also added)

2. Data annotated to support main verb detection more correctly. 
3. 2 systemic bug fixes related to repeated relations and predicate occuring in arg2.

## Bug fixes : 

1) The arg1 also occurs in arg2 . Essentially predicate occurs in its arguments because of wrong dependency issues.

{"喜欢": "我喜欢周杰伦的歌","pred": "喜欢.01","arg1": "2","arg2": ["1","2","3","4","5"]}

# Fix : Remove verb argument and everything before it.

2) Two relations with same arg1 and overlapping arg2
"patient": [{"喜欢": "周杰伦","pred": "喜欢.01","arg1": "2","arg2": ["3"]},{"喜欢": "我喜欢周杰伦的歌","pred": "喜欢.01","arg1": "2","arg2": ["1","2","3","4","5"]}]


# Next Version Info: 

1. Next SRL release will be Friday , 2/9/16. 
2. Training Data will include ~700 sentences from Memory data for different cases. 
3. User interface at /srlviz will be updated to show : 1) SRL Triple format 2) HIT Format data for more quick understanding
4. Addition of Evaluation metrics for SRL


# SRL 1.3.1 

It is released on taipei server (192.168.3.2) and dev server in shanghai (192.168.1.126)


1. New model SRL model trained on total 7043 sentences. 
2. Modified JSON to include version number and also verb type (primary, secondary). For. e.g.  真是个有孝心的好孩子。 Here, 是.01, 有.02
3. Added Form inputs on /srlviz visualisation page for selecting 1) model type (Emotibot, LDC Corpus). 2) Manual Mode. 
4. Many bug fixes related to data validation. Code can detect and fix 90% of syntax isses and missing information in conll format tagged data  based on 7043 sentences.
5. New submodule to generate SRL data in JSON format for data analysis in python


# Next Version Info: 

1. Next SRL release will be for 10000 trained sentences latest by monday, 29/8/16. 
2. This will also include much better main verbs identification as SRL system learns that as well from tagged data. We are enhancing the verbs priority when there are multiple verbs in a sentence clause , or multiple sentence clauses
3. Some bug fixes for e.g. verb argument in argument 2. for example : "研究"："研究飲食".

    * Model 2 : Model trained on emotibot data (current ~3000 sentences)
3.  Parse tree - Syntactic Parse tree output is added
4.  Segment Sentence - not enabled. 
5.  NER - Currently not implemented
